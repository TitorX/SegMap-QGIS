## Introduction

**What is SegMap?**  
SegMap is a **QGIS plugin** that leverages deep learning (DL) models to enable fast map digitization. Unlike traditional methods requiring labor-intensive polygon editing, SegMap allows users to extract objects of interest from aerial imagery with just a few clicks. This streamlined approach makes it significantly faster and more efficient for generating precise vector outputs.  

**Traditional vector editing vs. SegMap**  
- Old Workflow: Manual digitization of aerial features often demands **hundreds** of clicks to adjust polygon vertices.  
- SegMap Advantage: Achieves accurate results in **seconds with 1-5 clicks**, reducing effort by over 90%.  

**Key Features**  
- **Rapid Interactive Vectorization**: Extract objects to vector polygons using foreground/background clicks, guided by DL models.  
- **QGIS Integration**: Functions seamlessly within the QGIS environment, combining AI power with geospatial tools.  

By merging AI efficiency with user-friendly interaction, SegMap revolutionizes tasks like land cover mapping, infrastructure monitoring, and environmental analysis.
